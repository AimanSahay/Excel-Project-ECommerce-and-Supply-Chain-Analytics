## Overview
Welcome to the Ecommerce Excel Project repository! <br>
This project delves deep into the dynamics of supply chain management and digital consumer behavior, leveraging advanced Excel techniques to extract actionable insights. Through meticulous data analysis and innovative dashboard development, this repository showcases our journey in unraveling the narrative of supply chain excellence and digital footprints.

## Background

DataCo Analysis Group, renowned for its expertise in business analytics, provided two critical datasets: the supply chain metrics (DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv) and the digital access logs (TokenizedAccessLogs.csv). These datasets form the cornerstone of our analysis, enabling us to optimize operations and enhance digital strategies for our clients.

## Objective

Our primary objective is to conduct comprehensive analysis using Excel, focusing on data cleaning, integration, and the development of interactive dashboards. These dashboards serve as powerful tools to visualize supply chain efficiencies, customer engagement metrics, and their synergies. Our goal is to empower businesses with actionable insights for operational excellence and digital marketing strategies.
